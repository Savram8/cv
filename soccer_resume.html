  <p><em>Rollins College Footballer</em></p>

  <p1>Welcome! I am a soccer player at Rollins College. My dream is to play professional soccer. Some backround about me is that I usually play center-forward or left/right forward.
    This website is a updatable and my own live soccer resume. If you are looking for my professional page, please click the link above! On this page, you will be able to find stats, highlights and much more about me. Hopefully if I achieve my dream of becoming a footballer we will
    see bigger club names on here! Once again, Welcome!
  </p1>
